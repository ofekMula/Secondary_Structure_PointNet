	* Update copyright information (#64)
	* Add README.md (#62)
	* Support .mcif extension mkdssp (#51)

	* Added support for reading mmCIF files.

# 2.1.0 (04-06-2012)

	* Changed the assignment of helices. A pi-helix now takes precedence over
	an alhpa helix. This is based the article: Cooley, R.B. et al.,
	Evolutionary Origin of a Secondary Structure: π-Helices as Cryptic but
	Widespread Insertional Variations of α-Helices That Enhance Protein
	Functionality, J. Mol. Biol (2010).

# 2.0.5 (19-04-2012)

	* Several small tweaks based on feedback

# 2.0.4 (18-04-2012)

	* No longer add ligands to a chain after a TER record
	* Added a man page

# 2.0.3 (17-09-2011)

	* Accept duplicate PDB sequence numbers when they cross a chain barrier

# 2.0.2

	* Support for more than 9999 residues, write out residue nr correctly,
	truncate bridgepair number to 4 positions (suboptimal solution...)
